        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Income Generating Activities</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            Home of Hope gives a certain amount of money to the parent of CWDs on loan. The money is then used to buy raw materials to make crafts like jewelry, mats, bags.
            Home of hope then finds market for these products. From the profits, the parent can pay back the loan and continue with the business.
            This activity is meant to help needy parents find a source of income to support their children. The organization also empowers those with running businesses
            to increase on their capital.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Training Workshops</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            This program focuses on equipping parents, local leaders, opinion leaders, teachers and the community at large with knowledge on disability.
            So far Home of Hope has conducted seven workshops over the years. These have been conducted at small scale at home of hope offices.
            Much emphasis are put on the following areas:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>Training on children with disabilities rights</li>
            <li>Trainings on income generating activities</li>
            <li>Training teachers on working with CWDs in schools</li>
            <li>Trainings on prevention and management of different disabilities in the communities</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Child School Sponsorship</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            This is a very new program in Home of Hope, currently it cares for the educational needs of three (3) children with disabilities.
            Two of the above children go to El Shaddi Primary School (with inclusive education) and the other attend her classes at the Home of Hope
            therapy room with help of a special needs teacher. This program has only lasted a year but still struggling due to inconsistent funding.
            There is a total number of at least fifty one (51) children with disabilities in the waiting list. Thirty seven (37) of the above have
            physical disabilities while the remaining (14) of them are deaf.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Epilepsy Medication</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            After a research carried out by Home of Hope in its operational areas in Jinja district, it realized that there were a big number of
            epileptic patients in the villages who were not being treated. So the organization with help of its partners started a free monthly
            epilepsy medication program. This is carried out during outreach clinics.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
            This program is currently reaching an average of up to 70 (seventy) clients per clinic. However there is still need to continue sensitizing
            the local communities on the condition and the secondary disabilities that may occur as a result of severe epilepsy. The types of drugs
            used during the clinics include: phenytoin, phenobarbitone, carbamazepine and folic acid.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Adaptive Aids</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            Many of the children need wheelchairs and adaptive aids. The therapist assesses clients for different appliances according to the client’s
            needs and conditions. The clients are either referred or are provided with appliance by the organization. The organization gives up to a total
            of 4 appliances to clients in a month. These adaptive aids are classified into two that is those which are made by home of hope and those which
            are acquired from partner organization.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 font-semibold">Those made by Home of Hope:</p>

            <li>Toilet seats</li>
            <li>Parallel bars</li>
            <li>Walking frames</li>

        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Nutrition Support</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            Over time, Home of Hope has identified many children with severe malnutrition. This is either because of inadequate food or because
            of poor feeding habits among children with disability especially cerebral palsy. Research shows that there's a close relationship between
            Cerebral palsy and malnutrition. Most children with cerebral palsy have a problem with their feeding. They either have poor appetite or have
            problems with digestion.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
            Home of Hope works with many children in this category, thus the need to give nutritional support. Three areas are emphasized i.e. Giving
            of food supplies such as soya porridge, milk and Irish potatoes. Nutrition support is always given at Drop clinics, outreach clinics and during
            home visits. We mainly concentrated on 3 activities while carrying out this program: At present, Home of Hope are taking care of 40 children with
            malnutrition. All parents/care takers were given sensitization on nutrition, especially the use of locally available foods, the timing and quantity
            of food given to their children. Assessing the child’s progress, through observation and many other ways.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Drop-in Clinics</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            These clinics are carried out on every Tuesday at Home of Hope therapy room. Clients come from nearby villages and beyond to attend therapy.
            These clinics are conducted by the resident occupational therapist and in support of all Homes of Hope staff. In a day of the clinic an average
            of 7 clients are attended to in addition to our resident clients.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Support for Corrective Surgery</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            Because Home of Hope does not have surgical services, yet sometimes receive children with cases that need surgery, the organization refer them to
            places which offer the service. Home of Hope thus offer a certain percentage of the total costs towards the surgery.
